fsp is an alternative to ftp that comes with Debian Linux. In the pre-2.0r5 releases of the Debian Linux distribution, when the fsp package is installed it adds the ftp user to the passwd file without prompting or notifying the user/admin. With some ftp daemons, this is all that is needed to allow for anonymous ftp. 

The fsp package by itself is not exploitable, however, when it's installed it could unknowingly allow for other packages to be exploited. An example of this is wu-ftpd exploitable via realpath through anonymous ftp.
