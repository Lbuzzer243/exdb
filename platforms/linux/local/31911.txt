Vim is prone to multiple command-execution vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Successfully exploiting these issues can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the affected application.

Vim 7.1.298 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
