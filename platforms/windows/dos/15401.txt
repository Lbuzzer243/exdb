# Exploit Title: Gom Player : Wav Fact Chunk Size DOS.
# Date: 2nd November 2010
# Author: Fady Mohammed Osman.
# Software Link: http://www.gomlab.com/eng/GMP_download.html
# Version: 2.1.27.50.31
# Tested on: Win XP sp3

#Information : When an invalid size is supplied for the Fact chunk size the
program fails to initialize memory then it uses a value from this
uninitialized memory as a pointer to data. That's explains why the pointers
are filled with (BAADFOOD).

You can reproduce the bug by altering a valid wav file and change the fact
chunk size. you can use hex workshop for that since it's already has a wav
structure library, then click play and the application will crash.
