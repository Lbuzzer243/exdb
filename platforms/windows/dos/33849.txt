netKar PRO is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue will cause the server to copy data to a NULL pointer, which will crash the server, denying access to legitimate users.

netKar PRO 1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
