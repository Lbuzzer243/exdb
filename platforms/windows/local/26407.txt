1. Software Description:
------------------------
Internet kiosks offer high speed Internet access, Email sending, Office software, 
PC and online gaming, entertainment features. Antamedia Kiosk software helps you easily 
implement free or pay for use kiosks, and configure applications available for customer use.

2. Vulnerability Description:
-----------------------------
Antamedia Internet Kiosk fails to block requests made via the Search-ms Application Protocol, 
triggering a new window outside of the secure sandbox via explorer.exe that allows full navigation of the operating System.
even when all the security and policy settings are enforced (including block explorer.exe). Sucessful explotation of the vulnerability can be used to
modify the xml files containing the security and policy settings due to full access to read and write in the kiosk directory.

Note: A system reboot is requiered in order to reflect any made changes.
