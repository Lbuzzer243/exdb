The Economist 99 screen saver application (available from http://www.economist.com) may be configured to allow unauthorized users to access system resources without a password, even though the screen saver has been set to require NT user authentication. If the Password Protected checkbox has been enabled, it is still possible to launch Internet Explorer. Using IE, it is possible to browse local system resources and launch various applications.

If the screen saver is running under the context us the logged-on console user, the attacker will only have access to resources to which the logged-on console user has access.

When the economist screen saver is active, open Internet Explorer. Within Explorer, it is possible to access system resources.
