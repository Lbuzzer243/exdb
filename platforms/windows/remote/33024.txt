Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a cross-domain information-disclosure vulnerability because the application fails to properly enforce the same-origin policy.

An attacker can exploit this issue to access local files or content from a browser window in another domain or security zone. This may allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information or may aid in further attacks.
