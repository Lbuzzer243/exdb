Akella Privateer's Bounty: Age of Sail II is reportedly affected by a remote buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to do sufficient bounds checking on user-supplied input.

An attacker can leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code on an affected computer with the privileges of a user running a vulnerable version of the game.
