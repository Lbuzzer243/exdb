MS Windows NT 4.0/SP1/SP2/SP3/SP4/SP5/SP6 LsaQueryInformationPolicy() Domain SID Leak Vulnerability

source: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/959/info

The LsaQueryInformationPolicy() function can be used to retrieve an NT domain's SID from any workstation in that domain. This can be done remotely by an anonymous user through a null session. That SID can then be used to obtain lists of user's names and SIDs for brute force attacks.
