Liero Xtreme is reported prone to a remote format string vulnerability. 


It is possible that as a result of this issue, malicious data containing format specifiers will be interpreted literally by the application; this may result in attacker-specified memory being corrupted or disclosed, leading to arbitrary code execution. 

A successful exploit could result in a failure of the application or arbitrary code execution in the context of the application.
