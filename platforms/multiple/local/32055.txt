Netrw is prone to a command-execution vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Successfully exploiting this issue can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the affected application.

Netrw 127 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
