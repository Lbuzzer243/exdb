Live For Speed S2 is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to handle exceptional conditions.

An attacker could exploit this issue to restart races on vulnerable servers, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

Live For Speed S2 Z13 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
